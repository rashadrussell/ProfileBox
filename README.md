ProfileBox
==========

A jquery plugin that can be used on members list webpages. I did this to practice jquery, and you can see its implementation on my clubs website, http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/webmonkeys/2012/?page_id=93
Click on the first member to see this affect at its best. It works for all the other members, but I only filled
added information to the first member. There are a few easy bugs that still need to be fixed.

Bugs:
1.) Bubble box does not expand if content gets too big.

2.) If any member other than the first one is clicked, undefined will be returned 
on the bubble. If no information is given. I at least put all of the members names
on the bubble to cover this minor problem up.
